# 42-filler

In this project I had to create a player (bot) that will fight other bots on the on the famous (or not) Filler board. The rules are simple: two players fight on a board and, in turn, must place the piece given to them by the game master (a Ruby executable), thereby scoring points. 
The game ends when a piece cannot be placed. A small fun game project.
